# Production Deployment Guide

This guide shows how to deploy SolidityPG to a production environment where reviewers can access it seamlessly without any setup.

## 🚀 Recommended: Vercel Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare for Deployment
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test the production build locally
npm run preview
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy "~/SolidityPG"? Y
# - Which scope? [your-username]
# - Link to existing project? N
# - What's your project's name? soliditypg
# - In which directory is your code located? ./

# The app will be deployed with a URL like: https://soliditypg-xyz.vercel.app
```

### Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional)
If you own `soliditypg.com`:
```bash
# Add custom domain
vercel domains add soliditypg.com

# Point your domain's DNS to Vercel
# Add CNAME record: www.soliditypg.com → cname.vercel-dns.com
# Add A record: soliditypg.com → 76.76.21.21
```

## 🌐 Alternative: Netlify Deployment

### Option A: Git Integration
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Netlify
3. Set build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

### Option B: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## 📋 What This Deployment Includes:

### ✅ **Fully Functional Features:**
- **AI Chat System** - Works seamlessly via serverless API proxy
- **Code Editor** - Monaco editor with Solidity syntax highlighting
- **Project Persistence** - Local storage for user projects
- **Compilation** - Mock Solidity compiler with demo results
- **Multi-Provider AI** - Supports OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, etc.

### 🔧 **Production Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: Static React app served from CDN
- **API Proxy**: Serverless function handles AI API calls
- **CORS Handling**: Automatic CORS resolution for all browsers
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles any number of concurrent users
- **Zero Setup**: Reviewers just visit the URL and it works

## 🎯 **For Reviewers:**

Once deployed, reviewers can:

1. **Visit the URL** (e.g., https://soliditypg.com)
2. **Go to Options tab** and add their AI API key
3. **Start chatting** with AI that can edit code directly
4. **Use all features** without any installation or setup

### **Example Review Flow:**
```
1. Open https://soliditypg.com
2. Click "Options" → Add OpenAI API key → Save
3. Click "Chat" → Ask "create a hello world contract"
4. Watch AI generate code directly in the editor
5. Test compilation, file management, and all features
```

## 🔒 **Security Notes:**

- ✅ API keys stored in browser localStorage only
- ✅ Serverless proxy doesn't log or store API keys
- ✅ All communication over HTTPS
- ✅ No backend database or user accounts
- ✅ Stateless architecture

## 🚨 **Important:**

This production deployment will work perfectly for reviewers without them needing:
- ❌ Browser extensions
- ❌ Local proxy servers  
- ❌ CORS configuration
- ❌ Technical setup

The serverless API proxy automatically handles all CORS issues and provides seamless AI integration for any visitor to your site.
